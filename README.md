# dice_rolling_game
"""I've created a user input loop to roll dice that could be used for Dungeons and dragons or other similar games 
were a dice is rolled to determine an outcome.

In this instance I have used an example of a game were the goal is to rule as low a number as possible and having as high a skill score as possible is most beneficial. If a player rolls their dice (in this case a 100-sided dice) below theirskill score they will succeed ie: a roll of 40 with a strength skill score of 50. If they roll over their skill score they would fail ie: a roll of 60 with a strength skill score of 50. Depending on how far over or under they rollit may incur a higher level of success  or failure. Additional they may have a penalty to their roll or get a bonus diceto roll and must take the lower or higher result. The loop accounts for all these variables and allows players to easilyimport new characters in the main file."""

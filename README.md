# dice_rolling_game
"""I've created a user input loop to roll dice that could be used for Dungeons and dragons or other similar games 
were a dice is rolled to determine an outcome. If a player rolls their dice (in this case a 100-sided dice) below their
skill score they will succeed and fail if they roll over their skill score. Depending on how far over or under they roll
it may incur a higher level of success  or failure. Additional they may have a penalty to their roll or get a bonus dice
to roll and must take the lower or higher result. The loop accounts for all these variables and allows players to easily
import new characters in the main file."""
